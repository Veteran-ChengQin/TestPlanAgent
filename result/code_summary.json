It ensures that optimizations are applied selectively to avoid degrading performance in unsupported or mixed-use cases. Additionally, it integrates experimental tracking for measuring the impact of redundant clause removal.\n\n#### Constraints:\n- Does not optimize conditions requiring unpacking of the tags column or unsupported operators.\n- Alters the structure of combined conditions during optimization, though functional equivalence is maintained.\n"

Metadata for packages is updated and stored.\n3. **Shared Libraries**: Manages shared libraries used across virtual environments, including creation and upgrades.\n4. **App Execution**: Provides functionality to run apps installed in the virtual environment, either via entry points or console scripts.\n5. **Metadata Access**: Exposes properties to retrieve package metadata, main package name, and virtual environment name.\n\n#### Notable Methods:\n- `create_venv`: Creates a new virtual environment and configures shared libraries.\n- `install_package`: Installs a package with options for dependencies, apps, and metadata updates.\n- `remove_venv`: Deletes the virtual environment if it is safe to remove.\n- `upgrade_package`: Upgrades a package and updates its metadata.\n- `run_app`: Executes an app installed in the virtual environment.\n- `list_installed_packages`: Lists all packages installed in the virtual environment.\n\n#### Constraints and Side Effects:\n- Relies on external subprocess calls for Python and pip operations, which may fail if the environment is misconfigured.\n- Shared library management introduces dependencies on `pipx`-specific shared resources.\n- Metadata updates are tightly coupled with `pipx`'s internal structure, requiring compatibility with its versioning.\n\n#### Role in the System:\nThis class serves as the core utility for managing virtual environments in the `pipx` ecosystem, enabling seamless installation, execution, and management of Python applications in isolated environments.\n"

It takes a list of `Source` objects as input and dynamically configures the dialog based on the number of sources provided. If no sources are specified, it displays a warning; otherwise, it sets up confirmation text, buttons, and labels tailored to the number of sources. \n\nNotable behaviors include blocking the \"continue\" button if the number of sources exceeds a predefined threshold (`LOTS_OF_SOURCES`) and adjusting the dialog's size automatically. This method ensures the dialog is appropriately configured to handle both edge cases (no sources) and bulk deletion scenarios.\n",

It dynamically adjusts its content based on the number of sources provided, displaying warnings for empty selections or confirmation messages for deletions. If a large number of sources are selected, the dialog enforces a delay before enabling the \"Continue\" button to prevent accidental deletions.\n\n#### Key Behaviors:\n1. **Initialization**: Accepts a list of `Source` objects, determines the number of sources, and configures the dialog's text and buttons accordingly. If no sources are provided, it displays a warning and disables the \"Continue\" button.\n2. **Blocking Continue Button**: For large selections, the \"Continue\" button is disabled for a predefined delay (`CONTINUE_BUTTON_DELAY`), with periodic updates to the button's label showing the remaining wait time.\n3. **Dynamic Content**: Generates descriptive text about the consequences of deleting the selected sources, including truncating long lists of source names for readability.\n4. **Helper Methods**: Includes utilities for formatting source names and handling edge cases like empty selections.\n\n#### Role in the System:\nThis class is designed to ensure deliberate user actions when deleting sensitive source accounts, emphasizing clarity and caution through its UI design and enforced delays.
