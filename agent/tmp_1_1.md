### Thought
I will examine the provided PR content and related file changes to determine the appropriate testing method(s) and define test steps. The PR introduces a migration order validator feature, involving changes in the `snuba/migrations/validator.py` (a new file that implements the validator), modifications to migration scripts, and tests in `tests/migrations/test_validator.py`. This indicates that both unit and integration testing are necessary, as the changes include new functionalities with dependencies across different components (e.g., validator logic and its integration in CI).

I'll use the search tools to gather more information about the new validator and its associated test cases.

1. **Entity_1**: The new validator implementation in `snuba/migrations/validator.py`
2. **Entity_2**: The test cases in `tests/migrations/test_validator.py`

### Test Method:
* Unit test and Integration test

### Test Steps:

#### Unit Testing:
* Step 1: Verify file `tests/migrations/test_validator.py` is testing edge cases for the migration order validator logic:
  - Open the file and ensure it includes tests for all scenarios: `AddColumn`, `CreateTable`, `DropColumn` operations.
  - Check for tests that cover the correct and incorrect order detection.

#### Integration Testing:
* Step 2: Test the validator integration with the existing migration process.
  - Execute the migration process and verify that the validator script is invoked as a pre-check.
  - Validate through logs or output that the validator correctly identifies the corrected order in the modified migration files (`0004_drop_profile_column.py`, `0016_drop_legacy_events.py`, `0014_transactions_remove_flattened_columns.py`).

* Step 3: Run the full Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline and confirm:
  - The newly added validator test case is part of the CI build assertions.
  - The modified and added test steps pass successfully, indicating no regression or integration issues. 

* Step 4: Simulate scenarios with intentionally incorrect migration order:
  - Modify a copy of the migration files to revert the order change.
  - Run the validator and ensure it reports an order error, confirming its effectiveness.

### Result: succeed
