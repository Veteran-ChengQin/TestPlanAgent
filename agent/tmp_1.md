### Thought
After analyzing the PR description and file changes, I identified the following key aspects to guide my decision regarding the testing method and the test steps:

1. The PR introduces a **migration order validator** which involves scripts and validation logic. The validator ensures that migration operations for databases follow required order specifications.
2. **Unit tests** are already written for utility methods and parameterized tests to validate the migration logic. These unit tests are highly focused on individual logic components (e.g., checking specific rules for migration order validation).
3. An integration perspective is also required because the validator interacts with a database (Clickhouse) to parse table names and check distributed table orders. This necessitates **integration tests** to verify the validator against a realistic database environment.
4. File changes primarily involve introducing `validator.py`, modifying operations, and adjusting flags in migration scripts. A new test file `tests/migrations/test_validator.py` was also introduced.

To ensure comprehensive coverage, a combination of **unit testing** and **integration testing** is necessary.

I will now proceed to define the symbols, determine the relevant testing methods, and create detailed test steps.

1. **Symbol 1**: Code for the `validator` logic in `snuba/migrations/validator.py` 
   - File: "snuba/migrations/validator.py"
   - LOC: 1~199
   - Added as part of the PR.
2. **Symbol 2**: Updates to migration operations in `snuba/migrations/operations.py`
   - File: "snuba/migrations/operations.py"
   - LOC: 1~26
   - Modified to expose public attributes like table name and column.
3. **Symbol 3**: New test cases in `tests/migrations/test_validator.py`
   - File: "tests/migrations/test_validator.py"
   - LOC: 1~386
   - Contains unit tests and parameterized tests for validation rules.

### Test Method:
**Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing**

### Test Steps:

#### Unit Tests
1. **Utility Function Tests**:
   - Verify that utility methods in `validator.py` handle edge cases (e.g., invalid operation orders, absent columns).
   - Test each rule independently:
     - For `AddColumn` operations: Ensure local ops are applied first.
     - For `CreateTable` operations: Ensure local ops are applied first.
     - For `DropColumn` operations: Ensure distributed ops are applied first.
   - Use the parameterized unit tests from `tests/migrations/test_validator.py` to test various scenarios (valid/invalid orders).

2. **Conflict Detection Logic**:
   - Test scenarios where conflicting operations overlap on the same table/row/column.
   - Pass a mock ordered list of migration operations to ensure correct exceptions/messages are raised.
  
3. **Public Attribute Verification**:
   - Verify that the changes to `SqlOperations` in `operations.py` expose the necessary public attributes (e.g., table name, column) for validation purposes.

#### Integration Tests
4. **Database Table Validation**:
   - Set up a simulated (or real) Clickhouse database.
   - Create tables (local and distributed) that mimic real usage based on PR requirements.
   - Run the validator script and ensure correct parsing of table names/columns using Clickhouse queries.
   
5. **End-to-End Migration Validation**:
   - Deploy migrations (mock or real) from start to end and execute the validator script.
   - Validate that migration order checks do not falsely report errors if rules are respected.
   - Confirm expected errors are raised when rules are violated in the migration files.

#### Cross-Validation
6. **Existing Migration Files Check**:
   - Run the validator with the corrections introduced in modified migration files (`0016_drop_legacy_events.py`, `0004_drop_profile_column.py`, etc.).
   - Confirm that no errors are raised due to previously incorrect orders.

7. **Blast Radius Validation**:
   - Ensure the validator does not alter or affect existing migration execution behavior (no unintended consequences).

### Result: succeed
