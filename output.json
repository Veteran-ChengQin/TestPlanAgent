    "Description of changes": "Implemented a `PipelineBuilder` class for dynamically creating machine learning pipelines based on YAML configuration files. The class uses a factory pattern for modular and extensible pipeline creation, supporting operations like text-to-embedding, embedding-to-text, text segmentation, and metric analysis. Standardized configuration structures improve maintainability and scalability.",
    "Test plan": "Unit Testing:\n- Verified correct loading of configuration files.\n- Tested creation of pipelines for all supported operations.\n- Checked proper error handling for missing or unsupported configurations.\n\nCommand Line Testing:\n- Tested pipeline creation with example commands, including edge cases for missing files or unsupported operations.\n\nIntegration Testing:\n- Integrated `PipelineBuilder` into the main application workflow, ensuring correct pipeline execution with real datasets and validated logging for errors and key information.",
    "Others": "The directory structure for configuration files is designed for scalability, with each dataset having subdirectories for operation-specific YAML files. Future extensions for additional operations can be accommodated by creating new factory classes and updating the dictionary of factories. Additional error validation for configuration contents might be implemented in the future."
